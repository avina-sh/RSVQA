Introduction

Our deep learning solution uses a Visual Question Answering (VQA) model to address the demand for seamless interaction with geospatial information, empowering users to pose open-ended questions about remote sensing images and receive insightful answers. The model harnesses the capabilities of low and high-resolution datasets, extracting features from both images and questions. Through a layered architecture encompassing feature extraction, fusion, and prediction components, the model classifies answers effectively. Train the model on your unique remote sensing datasets to extract actionable insights and make geospatial data accessible and insightful with our VQA solution.
